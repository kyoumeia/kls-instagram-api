# Examples

_Note for JavaScript users:_
As of Node v.13.5.0, there isn't support for ESModules and the 'import'-syntax.
So you have to read the imports in the examples like this:

`import A from 'b'` âž¡ `const { A } = require('b').default`

```typescript
import LsInstagramBot from 'ls-instagram-api'
// or
const lsInstagramBot = require('ls-instagram-api').default

;(async () => {
  //-1) Setup individual bot for a acoount
  var bot = new LsInstagramBot({
    botName: 'linkstarry',
    isDevelopment: true,
    logScreenshot: true, //-** for PRODUCTION enviroments or non GUI os , you should set this options `true`
    log: true
  })
  await bot.start()

  //-2) Login acoount into created bot
  await bot.account.login({
    uname: 'username',
    password: 'pass'
  })

  //-3) and now your bot at your services sir!

  //-- Review Home post
  await bot.account.reviewHome({
    postReviewCount: 10,
    onPostReview: async targetPost => {
      // console.log('Post Review ...', targetPost);
      await targetPost.comment('Hello... ' + targetPost.owner)
    }
  })

  //-- load  and follow page
  await bot.page.Follow('meta')

  //-- Comment & like
  let targetPost = await bot.post.loadPostByUrl('https://www.instagram.com/p/CVTtCZotdJX/')
  await targetPost.like()
  await targetPost.comment('Hi friend...')
})()
```
